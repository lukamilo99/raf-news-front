# RAF News Frontend

## Description

This is the client-side part of our blog application developed using the Vue.js. It is single page application in which I used Vue Router to navigate through the application. To communicate with the backend, I used Axios HTTP client. It sent GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to the backend, which allowed me to fetch and display data, as well as persist changes made by users. JWT is generated on the backend and stored in the frontend. This token is then attached to every subsequent request, allowing the application to grant access.
